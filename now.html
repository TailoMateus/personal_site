What I'm DoingÂ Now

I'm trying to lead an exciting, yet habit-based life. This is what I spend my time doing:
* Training calisthenics with Thenx
* Doing ten-mile run in 50 minutes
* Trying to weigh 70kg
* Doing the course The Modern GraphQL Bootcamp (Advanced Node.js)
* Learning about React Hooks
* Trying to write a book on how to live a better life
* Improving my English with Daily Conversations and YouTube videos
* Reading The stand by Stephen King  and Mockingbird by Kathryn Erskine
* Talking to other people in English with Italki
* Reaching 100,000 views with my articles on tableless
