title: Is it possible to be more productive by doing less?
description: "What are the minority of my actions that drive the majority of my results?"

When typing in Google “Habits of successful people”, about 253,000,000 results (0.68 seconds). There is something strange about this, after all what is success? This is very relative, and throughout life it can change frequently.

*“Success is just about letting the universe know what you want and working toward it, while letting go of how it might come to pass”.*

For me, success is to act according to what is essential to my life. The first step is to understand yourself. This is not about being focused all the time or about being productive, but about taking small steps in the right direction.

*“Essentialism is not about how to get more things done; it’s about how to get the right things done. It is about making the wisest possible investment of your time and energy in order to operate at our highest point of contribution by doing only what is essential”.*

Often, to prioritize something we have to eliminate other less important things. For that, I think the concept of minimalism is perfect. Minimalism helps us become more aware of what we consume and for making better life decisions. The purpose isn’t to live with as few items as possible, but live with enough for you.

And it depends only on you, what is enough? Other questions can shape our intention (this will change over time), such as:

What is the most important thing I can do for my profession? or for my health? or my intellectual development?

After understanding and creating your list of essentials, ask yourself: *“What are the minority of my actions that drive the majority of my results?”*. For example, if having a healthy body is essential, what actions could you take to make it happen? Perhaps, exercising or running every day after leaving work can be valid actions. It’s important to note that when we schedule a specific time, we are committing ourselves.

With practice I noticed that some actions are habits, while others are part of a checklist. This can be a little confusing, but every action that has no end is a new lifestyle. Making it a new habit and part of your new identity.

*“*Changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years*”.*

**The big secret of habits is consistency**, for a habit to become natural you must be willing to persist and understand that the result is not immediate. Generally, those who manage to delay gratification tend to compromise more easily.

On the other hand, there are checklists. Everything that has an end can be used in this way, like writing this article. Creating a habit tends to be more difficult, as we do not have an immediate return with a simple “Done” of completed items.

Your life will not change drastically with a simple change, but what if you make one, and then one more, and so on. I’m sure it started with something very small, but achievable.

**Now, imagine what your life would be like if you dedicate your time to what is really important.**
