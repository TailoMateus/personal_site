    <li>Doing ten-mile run in 50 minutes</li>
    <li>Trying to weigh 70kg</li>
    <li>Doing the course The Modern GraphQL Bootcamp (Advanced Node.js)</li>
    <li>Learning about React Hooks</li>
    <li>Trying to write a book on how to live a better life</li>
    <li>Improving my English with Daily Conversations and YouTube videos</li>
    <li>Reading The stand by Stephen King  and Mockingbird by Kathryn Erskine</li>
    <li>Talking to other people in English with Italki</li>
    <li>Reaching 100,000 views with my articles on tableless</li>
  </ul>
