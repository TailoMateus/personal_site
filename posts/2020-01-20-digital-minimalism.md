title: What I learned from digital minimalism

Digital minimalism helps us to question which digital tools add the most value to our lives. I think itâ€™s extremely important to eliminate useless digital pursuits, and use the internet for a purpose that makes sense (creating or consuming something very useful). When we remove unnecessary things, we get time for what really matters.

In short, adopting digital minimalism gives us more time to focus on what we think is essential for us.
