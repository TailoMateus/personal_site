title: Prioritize the important things
description: "Do what is important and not what is urgent"
---


**"Do what is important and not what is urgent"**,  this sentence is incredible, unfortunately I don't know who the author is. This may seem a little clich√©d, mainly because I know that during the day things don't go as we want, often the train got off the rails and we just became another passenger of our own life, I understand you.

**Is what we think important really important?**

My decision was painful (I swear), but I removed all channels from youtube, most of the newsletter, greatly reduced the time of social media (almost zero). All this to get time for what I really love to do or where I want to go. Taking care of myself has become **PRIORITY**.

**"Productivity is not about doing many things, but doing things right"**
