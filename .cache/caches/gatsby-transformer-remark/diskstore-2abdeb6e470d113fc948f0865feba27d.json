However, I ventured into the dark side of the force (Back-end) and I can say that in many cases it wasn't a good thing.</p>\n<p>My goal is not to tell which language or framework is good or bad, but each person has a preference, you're not wrong if you don't like some technology.</p>\n<p>During the last five years, I’ve studied or worked with Java, C#, Zend Framework. I confess I’ve been disappointed with how many time it takes to configure the environment and build something visible.</p>\n<p>Besides that technologies, I ventured into something more agile, so I tried to learn Ruby on Rails and Laravel, although I appreciate it so much, I realized, in that moment, I still didn't found the appropriate framework and lan ideal for me. In spite of the frustrations I have not stopped participating in some project or learning something new, all the knowledge acquired I will be reused in other time. While I didn't find the backend language and framework I'll continued to study on the front end.</p>\n<p>For some time I started studying about <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/\">Node.js</a> and the <a href=\"https://expressjs.com/\">Express</a> framework and how in a few steps I can create an API. According to Express’s own website is a fast, flexible and minimalist web framework for Node.js.</p>\n<p>NOTE: If you do not know NPM, start with the link below:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://nodesource.com/blog/your-first-nodejs-package/\">Your first Node.js package</a></p>\n<p><strong>STEP 1 — Install Express</strong></p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">npm install express –-save</code></pre></div>\n<p><strong>STEP 2- Create the server.js file</strong></p>\n<p>At the beginning of the code is imported the <code class=\"language-text\">express</code> module and created an <code class=\"language-text\">app</code>. After it creates a route based on the HTTP method. The <code class=\"language-text\">res</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">req</code> objects are provided by the Node, equivalent to an HTTP request and a response. To finish I’m telling the created instance to listen on port 8080.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">const express = require(&#39;express&#39;);\nconst app = express();\n\napp.get(&#39;/&#39;, function (req, res) {\n return res.send(&#39;Hello world&#39;);\n});\n\napp.listen(process.env.PORT || 8080);</code></pre></div>\n<p><strong>STEP 3 — Start the Express server</strong></p>\n<p>If everything went well, just go to localhost: 8080.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">node server.js </code></pre></div>\n<p>Or if you prefer, use <a href=\"https://github.com/remy/nodemon\">nodemon</a> to automate this process.</p>\n<p>Obviously, with Node.Js and Express you can do several cool things, the introduction of this subject is precisely for you to research more and not be afraid to learn something new :D</p>\n<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>\n<p>As I mentioned at the beginning of the article, people have different preferences, and in my case it is essential to get a quick start with a technology, small rewards motivate me to continue studying.</p>\n<p>Also, make sure to test something new or to participate in some project for what they are using. There are good things for somethings and bad things for others.
